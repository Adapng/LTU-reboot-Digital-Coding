Reflection

In today's session I learnt that the web developnment industry is a rewarding, lucreative and creative industry to get into.

I also introduced myself to a class of strangers, this was initially a hard thing for me to do.

The part I enjoyed most was I am able to understand the lesson despite coming from Art background.

The part I found hard was getting to work with new technologies that I have not worked with before.
